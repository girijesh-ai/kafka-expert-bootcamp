## Your Current Status: Week 1 Fundamentals

### What You Need to Do Right Now:

1. **Run the environment setup**:
```bash
cd /home/spurge/tutorials/kafka
./scripts/setup-env.sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. **Start your Kafka cluster**:
```bash
cd docker
docker-compose up -d
```

3. **Complete Lab 1**:
   - Follow every step in `week-1-fundamentals/labs/lab-01-environment-verification.md`
   - Don't skip any verification steps
   - Ask questions if anything is unclear

4. **Once Lab 1 is complete, move to Lab 2**:
   - Read the theory first
   - Build the producer and consumer from scratch
   - Test thoroughly

### Daily Learning Schedule (Recommended):

**Morning (2 hours):**
- Read theory materials
- Understand concepts before coding

**Afternoon (3 hours):**
- Complete hands-on labs
- Build and test code
- Experiment with configurations

**Evening (1 hour):**
- Review what you learned
- Plan next day's work
- Document questions

### Getting Help:

1. **Check the documentation**: Each lab has troubleshooting sections
2. **Use Kafka UI**: Visual interface helps understand concepts
3. **Review logs**: Docker logs show what's happening
4. **Test systematically**: Break problems into smaller pieces

### Assessment Checkpoints:

**End of Week 1:**
- Can build basic producers and consumers
- Understands partitioning and consumer groups
- Comfortable with development environment

**End of Week 2:**
- Masters reliability configurations
- Handles errors gracefully
- Optimizes basic performance

**Weekly Review Questions:**
1. What did I learn this week?
2. What challenges did I face?
3. What concepts need more practice?
4. How does this apply to real-world scenarios?

## Important Notes:

### Time Investment:
- **Minimum**: 30 hours/week for basic proficiency
- **Recommended**: 40 hours/week for expert level
- **Intensive**: 50+ hours/week for rapid mastery

### Practical Focus:
- 70% hands-on coding and labs
- 20% theory and reading
- 10% research and exploration

### Success Mindset:
- **Practice daily**: Consistency beats intensity
- **Build projects**: Apply knowledge immediately
- **Debug everything**: Errors are learning opportunities
- **Question assumptions**: Understand the "why" behind best practices
